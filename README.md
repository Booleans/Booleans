I'm a data scientist who is passionate about learning and teaching others. When I'm not coding you can find me at the park with my dog Apollo, gaming with friends, or out on a bike ride.</p>

### 💼 Where I Work

[DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/): Data Science Trainer
### ✏️ In School For

MS in Computer Science with a specialization in machine learning. I'm enrolled through Georgia Tech's [OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) and started classes in the fall of 2021.

### 💻 Currently Working On

* [Simulation and Modeling for Engineering and Science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/isye-6644-simulation-and-modeling-engineering-and-science) as my second course in grad school. 

* Solving math, probability, and logic puzzles. Every Friday I check out the latest challenges posted by the [538 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) and store my solutions [here](https://github.com/Booleans/riddler-538). 

### 📚 Currently Learning More About:

* [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://www.routledge.com/Bayesian-Modeling-and-Computation-in-Python/Martin-Kumar-Lao/p/book/9780367894368)

### 💡 Future Learning Plans:

Since there are too many things to learn at once...

* [Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1492052590/)

* [Learning Test-Driven Development: A Polyglot Guide to Writing Uncluttered Code](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1098106474/)




### 💬 Ask Me About:

* Writing simulations to solve probability and statistics problems.
