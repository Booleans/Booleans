I'm a data scientist who is passionate about learning and teaching others. The repositories you'll see here are mostly for helping my students on their journey towards a new career in data science or simply fulfilling my personal quest for knowledge. When I'm not coding you can find me at the park with my dog Apollo, gaming with friends (currently playing Overwatch and Among Us) or out on a bike ride.

### üíº Where I Currently Work üíº

[Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.galvanize.com/data-science-bootcamp): Data Science Instructor

### üíª Currently Working On:

* A machine learning model to predict the return on investment of crowd-funded loans. I'd like to host this model online and combine it with an AWS Lambda job to perform automated investing with my own money. 

* Acquiring an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification. I love the power and flexibilty of AWS and can't wait to become an expert. I'm happy to promote [this excellent course](https://learn.cantrill.io/) created by [Adrian Cantrill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancantrill/). 

* Solving math, probability, and logic puzzles. Every Friday I check out the latest challenges posted by the [538 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) and store my solutions [here](https://github.com/Booleans/riddler-538). 

* A repo containing 200+ real data science interview questions with solutions to help my students get their dream jobs.

* Kaggle's [Airline Price Optimization Micro-Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/exercise-airline-price-optimization-microchalleng). I enjoy optimization problems and am using this as an exercise to learn more about Python's optimization libraries and reinforcement learning.

### üìö Currently Learning More About:

* Optimization algorithms. I purchased the book [Algorithms for Optimization](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262039427/) and have been enjoying being exposed to the Julia programming language. 

* Pytorch, with the help of the book/class [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/).

* Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919).

### üí¨ Ask Me About:

* Writing simulations to solve probability and statistics problems.
