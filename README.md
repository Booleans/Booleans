I'm a data scientist who is passionate about learning and teaching others. When I'm not coding you can find me at the park with my dog Apollo, gaming with friends, or out on a bike ride.</p>

### üíº Where I Work

[Galvanize Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.galvanize.com/data-science-bootcamp): Data Science Instructor, Data Scientist

### ‚úèÔ∏è In School For

MS in Computer Science with a specialization in machine learning. I'm enrolled through Georgia Tech's [OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) and begin classes in the fall of 2021.

### üíª Currently Working On

* [Practical Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science), learning how to combine my machine learning knowledge with AWS. 

* [Supply chain optimization](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/3110673916/) through simulation. I don't work in supply chain but enjoy solving "real world" problems with simulations. 

* Solving math, probability, and logic puzzles. Every Friday I check out the latest challenges posted by the [538 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) and store my solutions [here](https://github.com/Booleans/riddler-538). 

### üìö Currently Learning More About:

* Bayesian statistics with Python, with the second edition of the book [Think Bayes](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/149208946X/).

### üí° Future Learning Plans:

Since there are too many things to learn at once...

* [Machine Learning Engineering for Production MLOps Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops).

* Julia language with an [MIT course](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/). 

* [Discrete Optimization Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization).

* Even more optimization algorithms. I purchased the book [Algorithms for Optimization](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262039427/) but want to learn Julia before digesting the code.

* [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/).

* More Bayesian Statistics, primarily through the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919). I have [a repo](https://github.com/Booleans/statistical-rethinking) where I was translating the book's R code to Python but it's on the backburner while I prioritize other learning.

### üí¨ Ask Me About:

* Writing simulations to solve probability and statistics problems.
